["<p>Email phishing is very good</p>", "<p>Email phishing happens most in China</p>", "<p>Email phishing is a numbers game. An attacker sending out thousands of fraudulent messages can net significant information and sums of money, even if only a small percentage of recipients fall for the scam. As seen above, there are some techniques attackers use to increase their success rates.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">For one, they will go to great lengths in designing phishing messages to mimic actual emails from a spoofed organization. Using the same phrasing, typefaces, logos, and signatures makes the messages appear legitimate.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">In addition, attackers will usually try to push users into action by creating a sense of urgency. For example, as previously shown, an email could threaten account expiration and place the recipient on a timer.", "Applying such pressure causes the user to be less diligent and more prone to error.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">Lastly, links inside messages resemble their legitimate counterparts, but typically have a misspelled domain name or extra subdomains. In the above example, the&nbsp;myuniversity.edu/renewal&nbsp;URL was changed to&nbsp;myuniversity.edurenewal.com. Similarities between the two addresses offer the impression of a secure link, making the recipient less aware that an attack is taking place.</p>"]
